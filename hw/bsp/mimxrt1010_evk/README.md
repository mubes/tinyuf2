To deploy on mimxrt1010_evk open the `RT1010-EVK` drive and drag/drop the hex version of the compiled file `_build/build-mimxrt1010_evk/mimxrt1010_evk-firmware.nex` onto it.

After 5 seconds or so the drive `UF2BOOT` will appear.

To get back into tinyUF2 mode once firmware has been deployed, press SW9 on the evk twice within 500mS and the `UF2BOOT` drive will appear again.
